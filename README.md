# ComputerShop - Build on NextJS/Mongo/Node Stack

## What is it ?

It's simple computer shop build on modern JS stack - NextJS (React), Mongo, NodeJS.
Purpose was to see how developing real, commercial project would looks like.
Because of that ommitted some things like session mechanism etc. 
I think this level of complexity is enough to see real stack advantages and disadvantages.

## Conclusion

I was really happy to develop application especially frontend part. It's really mature and allows skip many 
secondary issues which I have in past during developing frontend. 
It's easy and comfortable like runnning this app in docker :-)
Most things run out-of-the-box and it doesn't require any configuration.
It's really **developer-friendly**.

## Running
Just type command below in console from directory of project

`docker compose up`
