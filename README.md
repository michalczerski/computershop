# ComputerShop. Build on NMN stack - NextJS/Mongo/NodeJS

## What is it ?
It's simple computer shop build on modern JS stack - NextJS (React), Mongo, NodeJS.
Purpose was to see how developing real, commercial project would looks like.
Because of that ommitted some things which aren't necessary to have hands-on experience. 
I think this level of complexity is enough to see real stack advantages and disadvantages.

## Features
### Purchases
ComputerShop allows browsing products, buying entire sets of parts, adding it to basket,
making orders and showing history of purchases.
### Account
In order to make purchase you have to register. Everything is stored on your computer.
To login just use your username and password than you can make orders and browser history of your purchases.
It's possible to edit basic account information.

## Conclusion
I was really happy to develop application especially frontend part. It's really mature and allows skip many 
secondary issues which I have in past during developing frontend. 
It's easy and comfortable like runnning this app in docker :-)
Most things run out-of-the-box and it doesn't require any configuration.
It's really **developer-friendly**.

## Running
Type `docker compose up` in console from project root directory 
and then [browse http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
